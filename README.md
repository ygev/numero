**Use Case**
Numeric frame names have small hitboxes, and this plugin bandaids the issue by renaming those numbers into words. A more expanded use case coming soon.

**Instructions**
Simply run the plugin if you have frames with numeric names that you want to be converted into words.

**Future Developments**
A UI that expands the use of a number to word algorithm to text layers and other element names.



*Waiting to get approved by Figma. I would be very surprised if they do.*
